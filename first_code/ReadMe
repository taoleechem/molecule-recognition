Hi:

GCC compiler must add -std==c++11, such as: 
gcc -std==c++11 file.cpp  

The code includes 5 .cpp files and 1 .h file, as well as a shell script.
To correctly compile and run this programme, NWchem should be pre-installed in Ubuntu os. And in the shell script "cd /your/file/name/" should be modified to your own filename.

Best Regard!
